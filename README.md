# react-calendar
A simple calendar app that displays month days, adds day events and saves them locally.

You can see it live in a [demo page](https://aargiriou.github.io/csb-l7wcpe/)

# Install the app
Clone the project and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. 

Run `npm run build` to build the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

When the `build` folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

> `npm install -g serve`
>
> `serve -s build`
